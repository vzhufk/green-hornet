### :poop: Purpose:

It's useless, as Maluyk :wheelchair:

### :rocket: How to run:

You need **Node.js v12+** and **npm/yarn**. (Further would be used `npm`).

Pull repository.
Get dependencies

```
npm i
```

Copy `sample.env` file. Rename new one to `.env` and provide needed credentials/configs.

To start anything you need to:

```
npm run start:dev
```

### :speech_balloon: Customize:

`assets` folder is up to you. Hope you will figure out what to do.
